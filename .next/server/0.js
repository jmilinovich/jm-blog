Since then, we’ve had the privilege of working with 150 fast-growing companies to help them with their branding, web, marketing and product design. Today, I’m excited to share the next next chapter in Aesthetic’s mission. **Our design agency business has been acquired by [CollabWest](https://www.collabwest.com/?utm_source=aesthetic&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=announcement)!** \n# What’s Next for our Design Agency\nThrough this transition, the Aesthetic design agency team will stay intact and will be given even more autonomy to innovate on our best-in-class process and design methodologies for working with companies at their earliest stage and as they grow. Over the last few years we’ve had the great fortune of recruiting a truly world class design team to run the day-to-day of our design agency. Our Creative Directors and Engagement Managers came from the biggest companies and design agencies in the world to work on this shared mission of accessibility and to collaborate with some of the most innovative new startups in the world. \n\nI’m ecstatic to see the impact we’ve been able to make in such a short amount of time, and am humbled by the fact that what we’ve built will be able to continue on and provide value in the world. Design has only become a more important driver of success since we started Aesthetic, and I’m so excited to see how much more of a dent our team will be able to make as a part of CollabWest. \n# What’s Next for Aesthetic \nWhile the design agency team will remain whole and continue partnering with our existing clients in the same manner the startup community has come to love, this moment represents an important shift for Aesthetic and its founding team. As a byproduct of our learnings from operating our design agency we’ve identified an opportunity to build a software product that automates the manual work that plagues designers and marketers who are trying to promote their company’s goods and services online today.\n\nFor the last 6 months, our team has been building an extensible design generation platform that can massively generate branded design assets based on a company’s content. Today, we’re unveiling our new product, which auto-generates videos and images from a company’s website for use in organic and paid social media. This product is a perfect combination of our team’s background in graphics programming, data mining and social marketing. You can learn more about this new product and join our waitlist at the [new Aesthetic website](https://www.aesthetic.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=collabwest-acquisition).\n# Thank You to our Customers\nWe’re incredibly thankful to all of the customers we’ve had the pleasure of working with over the last 30 months. As a team and as an individual I can say that my rate of learning has never been higher than during this chapter of my career. I feel incredibly indebted to have been trusted with such critical pieces of our customers’ success during this chapter in our company, and am excited to continue being able to support you during this next chapter for CollabWest and Aesthetic.\n");
