A dev blog starter for 2020.

- Works as a Markdown static-site generator out of the box
- Supports static exporting and hot reload (powered by Next.js)
- Makes it easy to write custom pages/code in React + TypeScript
- Out of the box support for code blocks with syntax highlighting

Read more about the motivation + design behind Devii at [https://vriad.com/blog/devii](https://vriad.com/blog/devii).

## Get started

To get started, clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```
git clone git@github.com:vriad/devii.git my-blog
cd my-blog
yarn
```

Then start the development server with `yarn dev`. This should start a server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Powered by Next.js

The core of this repo is [Next.js](https://https://nextjs.org). We chose Next.js because it's the simplest, most elegant way to generate a static version of a React-based website. The documentation is excellent; read it first: [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

The important con

## Project structure

Here's is an abbreviated version of the project structure. Certain config files (`next.config.js`, `next-end.d.ts`, `.gitignore`) have been removed for simplicity.

```
.
├── README.md
├── public // all static assets (images, css, etc) go here
├── pages // every .tsx component in this dir becomes a page of the final site
|   ├── index.tsx // the home page (which has access to the list of all blog posts)
|   ├── blog
|       ├── [blog].md // a template component that renders the blog posts under `/md/blog`
├── md
|   ├── blog
|       ├── devii.md // this page!
        ├── whatever.md // every MD file in this directory becomes a blog post
├── components

├── loader.ts // contains utility functions for loading/parsing Markdown
├── node_modules
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
```

Next.js generates a new webpage for each file in the `pages` directory. If you want to add an About page to your blog, just add `about.tsx` inside `pages` and start writing the page.

By default the repo only contains two pages: a home page (`/pages/index.tsx`) and a blog page (`/pages/[blog].md`).

The file `[blog].ts` follows the Next.js convention of using square brackets to indicate a [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).

## The home page

The home page is intentionally minimal. You can put whatever you want in `index.tsx`; one of our goals in designing Devii was to place no restrictions on the developer. Use your imagination! Your website is the online manifestion of you. You can use whatever npm packages or styling libraries you like.

## Styling

Devii is unopinionated about styling. Because your Devii site is a standard React app under the hood, you can use your favorite library from `npm` to do styling.

Devii provides certain styles by default, notably in the Markdown renderer (`/components/Markdown.tsx`). Those styles are implemented using Next's built-in styling solution `styled-jsx`. Unfortunately it was necessary to make those styles global, since `styled-jsx` [doesn't play nice](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx/issues/573) with third-party components (in this case `react-markdown`).

Feel free to re-implemement the built-in styles with your library of choice If you choose to use a separate styling library ([emotion](https://emotion.sh/) is pretty glorious) then you could re-implement the default styles

## Adding a new blog post

Just add a Markdown file under `md/blog/` to create a new blog post.

Breakdown:

1. Create a new Markdown file called `foo.md` within the `/md/blog` directory
2. Add in some basic Markdown content
3. Then go to `http://localhost:3000/blog/foo`. You should see the new post.

## Frontmatter support

Every Markdown file can include a "frontmatter block" containing various metadata. This is the frontmatter blog from the sample blog post (`md/blog/test.md`):

```
---
title: Introducing Devii
subtitle: Bringing the power of React, TypeScript, and static generation to dev blogs everywhere
datePublished: 1589064522569
author: Ben Bitdiddle
tags:
  - Devii
  - Blogs
authorPhoto: /profile.jpg
bannerPhoto: /brook.jpg
thumbnailPhoto: /brook.jpg
---
```

This metadata will be loaded and parsed into a TypeScript object with the following type.

```ts
type PostData = {
  path: string;
  title?: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  content: string;
  datePublished?: number;
  author?: string;
  authorPhoto?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  bannerPhoto?: string;
  thumbnailPhoto?: string;
};
```

## Medium-inspired design

The Markdown renderer (`Markdown.tsx`) provides a default style inspired by Medium. Just modify the CSS in `Markdown.tsx` to customize the design to your liking.

## GitHub-style code blocks

You can easily drop code blocks into your blog posts using triple-backtick syntax ([just like GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)). No more embedding CodePen iframes! 🚀

Works out-of-the-box for all programming languages. Specify your language with a "language tag". So this:

  <pre>
  ```ts
  // pretty neat huh?
  const test = (arg: string) => {
    return arg.length > 5;
  };
  ```</pre>

turns into

```ts
// pretty neat huh?
const test = (arg: string) => {
  return arg.length > 5;
};
```

### Markdown loading

_You don't need to understand all of this to use Devii. Consider this an "advanced guide" you can use if you want to customize the structure of the site._

Markdown posts are loaded during Next.js static build step. Check out the [Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) documentation to learn more about this.

Here's the short version: if export a function called `getStaticProps` from one of your page components, Next.js will execute that function, take the result, and pass the `props` property (which should be another object) into your page as props.

You can dynamically load and parse a Markdown file using `loadMarkdownFile`, a utility function implemented in `loader.ts`. It is an async function that returns a `PostData` TypeScript object containing all the metadata keys listed above:

For an example of this, check out the `getStaticProps` implementation from the homepage. The function calls `loadBlogPosts` - a utilty function that loads _every_ blog posts in the `/md/blog/` directory, parses them, and returns `PostData[]`.

```ts
export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const posts = await loadBlogPosts();
  return { props: { posts } };
};
```

There are a few utility functions in `loader.ts` that Devii uses.

- `loadPost` loads/parses a Markdown file and returns a `PostData`. It takes on argument, the name of a file in the `md/` directory. For instance `loadPost('about.md')` would load `/md/about.md` and `loadPost('blog/test.md'`) would load `/md/blog/test.md`.
- `loadBlogPosts`: loads/parses all the files in `/md/blog/`. Returns `PostData[]`. Used in `index.tsx` to read a list of all published blog posts.
- `loadMarkdownFile`: loads a Markdown file but doesn't parse it. Returns the string content. Useful if you want to implement certain parts of a page in Markdown and other parts in React.
- `loadMarkdownFiles`: accepts a [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) pattern and loads all the files inside `/md/` whose names match the pattern. Used internally by `loadBlogPosts`.

## Static generation

You can generate a fully static version of your site using `yarn build && yarn export`. This step is entirely powered by Next.js. The static site is exported to the `out` directory.

After its generated, use your static file hosting service of choice (Firebase Hosting, Amazon S3, Vercel) to deploy your site.

## Insanely customizable

There's nothing "under the hood" here. You can view and modify all the files that provide the functionality listed above. Devii just provides a project scaffold, some Markdown-loading loading utilities (in `loader.ts`), and some sensible styling defaults (especially in `Markdown.tsx`).

To get started customizing, check out the source code of `index.tsx` (the home page), `BlogPost.tsx` (the blog post template), and `Markdown.tsx` (the Markdown renderer).
